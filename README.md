### Stages

download files -> stg -> cln -> transform data

Staging: Load the raw files as is without any transformation

cleansing stage: Apply data quality rules like check date format, null values, invalid records etc

Transform data: Apply data transfoamtion rules, split the data into multiple tables based on the data model

Control tables as part of frame work:
file_load_status:  to track all the files downloaded from web and its import staus
job_status: to track status of each stage 
record_cnt_reconcile: to keep track of no of records loaded at each stage along with table names for data reconciliation

Workflows: Airflow is used to create the workflos and set the dependencies among the tasks
Configure email notifications on failure.
We can set the retreis option to 3 or something to retry the task before terminating especially while downloading files from web.


Tables: 
staging:  tripdata_stg
Clean STage: tropdata_cln
dw :  station_dim. (station_id, station_name, station_code,logintude,lattitude)
      rides_fact.  (ride_id,rideable_type,started_at,ended_at,start_station_id,end_stattion_id,member_casual)
      
      DB Objects created
      
       Schema |            Name             |   Type   | Owner 
--------+-----------------------------+----------+-------
 public | load_status_ctl             | table    | admin
 public | load_status_ctl_id_seq      | sequence | admin
 public | rides_fact                  | table    | admin
 public | stations_dim                | table    | admin
 public | stations_dim_station_id_seq | sequence | admin
 public | tripdata_cln                | table    | admin
 public | tripdata_stg                | table    | admin
      
While transforming the data from cln -> dw , first get all the station related data to the dim table.
Lookup the station id while loading rides_fact table

### Containers
Created separate containers for postgresql and airflow for this project
